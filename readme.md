-----

0-Setting base environment

1- Install and set environment for the spring boot

2-Install web dependancies

3-Create application

4-Create controller

5-Set basic endpoints (get account, create account, delete accounts, update accounts) 	
*Started server and tested if comes with the desired response.

6-Added needed dependencies data-jpa, mysql-connector-java 	
*Gone to “https://mvnrepository.com/“ and found the both of the extensions ( data-jpa, mysql-connector-java)

7-Configure application.properties file

8-Create the AccountDetailsRequestModel (model that will be accepted from request endpoints).

9-Create the AccountRest(“model” that will be returned as responses).

10-Create AccountDto (data transform objects and adding UUID support).

11-Implmenting the AccountDto and the AccountRest. To the create endpoint
 	*imported BeanUtils to copy properties from the request to the AccountRest
  	then used beanUtils again to copyProperies from the database.(not implemented yet)

12-Create AccountServiceImplmentation and AccountServiceInterface.

13-Create the AccountEntity to be the model given to the database.
	*set some parameter such as (nullable and length)
	
14-Create the AccountRepository (that will be handling everything from standards queries to te database)

15-Create function for the AccountServiceImplementation to handle the save into database 	*test it and it fails… 		*find error

16- Fix error temporarily that need to set id and it’s not auto generating.
	*test it and it passes. 17- checks if name is a full name (creation endpoint).

18- sets the only currency accepted from the bank (EUR it was not specified so I set it at the model to make it a little easier).

20-change the name field to be unique (Entity modification);

21- Create the get account endpoint (not working yet).

22- Create the get account by UId at the account service

23- Create the find by UId at the account Repository
 	*test it and find bugs
	
24- Add the Uid to be shown at the accountRest

25- Added dependency to handle both json and xml (Jackson-dataformat)

26- implemented the dependency into my controller.
        *test now it works both xml and json
	
27- create the error messages enum. (With the constants that I think I’m going to use for error handling)

28 - Added fast test of exception handler (account controller)

30- Created Customized ErrorMessage object and implemented it to 

31- Added the general exception handler to all api.
